    "signal": "BUY",
    "confidence": "High",
    "predicted_gain_pct": 8.5,
    "gain_prediction_rationale": "Strong technical breakout from a consolidation phase, supported by positive sector momentum.",
    "keyInsight": "Reliance is showing exceptional relative strength and is poised for a short-term up-move.",
    "analystVerdict": "The convergence of strong technicals, positive sector outlook, and supportive market regime creates a high-probability long setup. The stock has cleared a key resistance level and shows significant upside potential.",
    "keyRisks_and_Mitigants": {
        "risk_1": "A sudden broad-market downturn could negate the setup.",
        "risk_2": "Failure to hold the breakout level would indicate a false move.",
        "mitigant": "A strict stop-loss can be placed just below the breakout support level."
    },
    "thesisInvalidationPoint": "A daily close below 2800 would invalidate the bullish thesis.",

        "confluencePoints": ["Strong technical breakout", "Sector outperformance", "Bullish market regime"],

    "signal": "HOLD",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "predicted_gain_pct": 2.1,
    "gain_prediction_rationale": "The stock is currently range-bound with conflicting technical signals.",
    "keyInsight": "TCS is in a neutral phase; waiting for a clearer directional signal is the prudent approach.",
    "analystVerdict": "While the company's fundamentals are strong, the technical picture is ambiguous. The stock is caught between its 20 and 50-day moving averages, and options data suggests a lack of immediate directional bias. No clear trading edge exists at this moment.",
     "keyRisks_and_Mitigants": {
        "risk_1": "A breakdown below key support could initiate a new downtrend.",
        "risk_2": "Choppy, directionless price action can lead to small, frustrating losses if a trade is forced.",
        "mitigant": "The best action is to remain on the sidelines until a clear trend emerges."
    },
    "thesisInvalidationPoint": "A breakout above 4100 or a breakdown below 3850 would establish a new trend.",
